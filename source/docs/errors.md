# Error Handling

Sajya tries to fully comply with the standards and expectations that apply to [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/errors). For example, with the `debug` option enabled in the `config/app.php` configuration file, the response error information will contain much more information.


## Reporting Exceptions

Well as in HTTP, where certain types of errors are ignored, such as 404 "not found" errors or 419 responses generated by invalid CSRF tokens. JSON-RPC has the following ignored exceptions that will not be logged:


- Invalid params (-32602)
- Invalid request (-32600)
- Method not found (-32601)
- Parse error (-32700)
