# Error Handling

Sajya tries to fully comply with the standards and expectations that apply to [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/errors). For example, with the `debug` option enabled in the `config/app.php` configuration file, the response error information will contain much more information.

## Throw Exceptions

During operation, you can throw exceptions that will be converted into a valid JSON-RPC response without your intervention. For example:

```php
declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Http\Procedures;

use Exception;
use Sajya\Server\Procedure;

class TennisProcedure extends Procedure
{
    public static string $name = 'tennis';

    public function ping()
    {
        throw new Exception('Division by zero.', -100);
    }
}
```

Will lead to the following response:

```json
{
    "id": "1",
    "error": {
        "code": -100,
        "message": "Division by zero."
        ....
    },
    "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}
```

In order not to repeat, you can make your exception class for this, use inheritance from `Sajya\Server\Exceptions\RpcException`.


## Reporting Exceptions

Well as in HTTP, where certain types of errors are ignored, such as 404 "not found" errors or 419 responses generated by invalid CSRF tokens. JSON-RPC has the following ignored exceptions that will not be logged:


- Invalid params (-32602)
- Invalid request (-32600)
- Method not found (-32601)
- Parse error (-32700)
